Parker Chetan,5,"iPhone 11 is a good phone. Not a very big difference between 12 except for the OLED screen and a very minor camera improvement which is you cant make a difference. If you are planning for a iPhone and you have budget you definitely can go for this without second thoughts. Now some people are complaining and giving review 0 or so because there is no charger and headphones, but thats been already mentioned so I assume they are illiterate. Its not that Flipkart is removing them duh. Anyways bee...READ MORE"
